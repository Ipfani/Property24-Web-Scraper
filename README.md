Properties for sale on property24 using web scraping


**Main AIM**
* The main aim was to create a csv file that will consist of raw data of properties that are for sale under the website property24.com
* In order to change the place of interest, the user will have to copy and paste new index link of the location.
* The program will iterate through the pages available under the website until it reaches the last page.
* Currently i set the maximum pages to be 50 , which can be changed by changing the value of max_pages.

**Future Plan**
* The future plan is to take the csv file and load it into the dataframe, clean the data.
* Then use the data to create a model to predict the price.
* I created this project to practice the knowledge gained through **World Quant University - Data Science Lab**.
